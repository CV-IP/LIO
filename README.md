# Look-into-Object: Self-supervised Structure Modeling for Object Recognition

By [Mohan Zhou](https://mhzhou.com/), Yalong Bai, Wei Zhang, Tiejun Zhao, and Tao Mei.

## Introduction

This project is a LIO pytorch implementation of [*Look-into-Object: Self-supervised Structure Modeling for Object Recognition*](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zhou_Look-Into-Object_Self-Supervised_Structure_Modeling_for_Object_Recognition_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf), CVPR 2020.

## Getting Started

Implementations for image classification would be released in few days.

Implementations for image detection and segmentation can be found in [segmentation/](./segmentation/).
